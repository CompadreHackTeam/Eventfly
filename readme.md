# Eventfly API

Eventfly API is a service created in Node.js using MongoDB that offers chat based on 'geofences'. 

The project was born in the "Hack for Good 2016" event in the Escuela Polit√©cnica (Extremadura University), after that we decided to go on with that forming the "Compadre Hack Team" as a learning and personal growing project.

* [MongoDB] - High performance noSQL DB
* [JsonWebToken] - JSON-based open standard (RFC 7519) for creating tokens
