# Eventfly API

Eventfly API is a service created in Node.js using MongoDB that offers chat based on 'geofences'. 

The project was born in the "Hack for Good 2015" event in the Escuela Polit√©cnica (Extremadura University), after that we decided to go on with that forming the "Compadre Hack Team", wich is composed by Alberto de la Fuente and Ricardo Flores Rosco as a learning and personal growing project.
