# Eventfly API

Eventfly API is a service created in Node.js using MongoDB that offers chat based on 'geofences'. 

The project was born in the "Hack for Good 2015" event in the Escuela Polit√©cnica (Extremadura University), after that we decided to go on with that forming the "Compadre Hack Team", wich is composed by Alberto de la Fuente and Ricardo Flores Rosco as a learning and personal growing project.

## EndPoints

Please note that the POST services requires a valid token from an authenticated user

### Events
    
- **/getEvents** Gets all events stored in the database.
- **/getEventsByLocation/:latitude/:longitude/:radius** Gets all the events that are inside the _radius_ of a certain _longitude_ and _latitude_.
- **/getEventsByTag/:tagName** Gets all the events that contains _tagName_. 
- **/createEvent** Post a new Event to mongoDB.

## Tech

Eventfly uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [MongoDB] - High performance noSQL DB
* [JsonWebToken] - JSON-based open standard (RFC 7519) for creating tokens
